Title:
Resume Named Entities Recognition with SpaCy

Abstract:
A common issue among recruiters in big companies during their resume reviewing is that they often have to spend large amounts of time identifying important information on the applicantsâ€™ resumes. This paper uses Named Entity Recognition models to help identify and highlight core information on a resume, so recruiters can narrow down their focus and review resumes efficiently. To achieve this goal, we implemented spaCy module as the foundation architecture  and trained the token to vector, RoBERTa-based, and transition-based NER models within the pipeline. After rounds of model fine-tuning, we are able to achieve a 0.426 F1 score in spaCy model. To further improve model performance, we can consider using a more robust labeling technique and gathering diverse datasets. The model code can be found at https://github.com/QiwenZz/resume_NER.
